   <h2>üíú About Me</h2>
    <p>As a Full Stack developer, my heart truly beats for the frontend. I specialize in building engaging and intuitive user interfaces with modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. My backend skills complement this passion, allowing me to deliver complete solutions.</p>
    <p>I'm a strong believer in the power of open-source and always look for opportunities to contribute to impactful projects or start new ones, whether working solo or collaborating with others. My goal is to create things that make a real difference.</p>
    <p>A keen eye for detail drives my work. I'm passionate about aesthetics, user experience (UX/UI), and ensuring a perfect balance in every design.</p>

   <h2>üå∏ In My Free Time</h2>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I'm usually perfecting my skills by applying them in new ways. I also love to relax by playing games, listening to music (my playlist), and enjoying anime.</p>
